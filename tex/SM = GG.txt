Number of elemets in database:
in both databases there are n elements

induction over n:
n=1, clear (since there is only one matching)
n + 1 -> n: if largest similarity not matched, then
contradiction to stability (hence we don't need 
to consider the largest match). So we just look
at the n elements.
