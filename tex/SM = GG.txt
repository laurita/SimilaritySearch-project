Number of elemets in database:
in both databases there are n elements

induction over n:
n=1, clear (since there is only one matching)
n + 1 -> n: if largest similarity not matched, then
contradiction to stability (hence we don't need 
to consider the largest match). So we just look
at the n elements.



Assume two item sets with n elements
Suppose the distance values are unique
(If they are not define an ordering on the non-unique ones).

Induction over number of elements in database
For n = 1 this is clear since only one match possible, so GG = SM
For n + 1 -> n: 
GG will first match elements with smallest distance
For SM ranking, these two items are respectively the most preferred ones
Hence they have to be matched in any stable matching
This means this match will be included in any SM and GG matching
and we only need to consider the remaining n elements.

For databases with different number of items, this proof can easily be adapted.
